# SpaceTraveler

## General
A UFO traveling through space while its trajectory is influenced by the nearest planet.

The UFO starts at the position (0/0) and tries to leave space by traveling diagonally (+1 in each axis direction per step).
The nearest planet will always influence the UFO's trajectory each step, by pulling the UFO towards the planet's direction.

The goal is to leave space without crashing into any planet.
